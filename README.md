# Test Vault

This is a test Obsidian vault for testing the AI README Unhide plugin.

## Files in this vault:
- This README file (visible)
- .ai/README.md (hidden by default, should become visible with plugin)
- Other project files and documentation

## Testing the Plugin:
1. Look for the eye icon in the left ribbon
2. Try the Command Palette: "Toggle .ai/README.md file visibility"
3. Check if .ai/README.md appears in the file explorer when toggled on
4. Verify it can be clicked to open
5. Check status bar shows "AI files: visible/hidden"
