# üéØ obsidian-unhide - Cumulative Development Project

**üõë MANDATORY BEHAVIORAL INTERRUPT**: Before reading ANY project files, you MUST complete CAC context loading first. **NO EXCEPTIONS**.

**AI Assistant**: You've found the obsidian-unhide development project context system. Please:

### Step 1: CAC System Loading (REQUIRED FIRST)
- [ ] Load C:\Git\CompanyAiContext\.ai\README.md and execute its discovery map consultation instruction
- [ ] Load the behavioral anchors specified in the discovery map  
- [ ] **Session ID**: Generate using `window.CAC_SYSTEM.sessionId.generate("obsidian_plugin")`
- [ ] Log: "cac_system_loaded_before_project_work"

### Step 2: Development Context Integration (AFTER SYSTEM LOADING)
- [ ] Skip for now

### Step 3: Development Environment Assessment
- [ ] **Environment Detection**: Confirm Claude Desktop + MCP capabilities
- [ ] **Tool Availability**: Validate filesystem access, JavaScript REPL, artifact creation
- [ ] **Constraint Awareness**: Note subprocess limitations, file execution restrictions
- [ ] **Development Strategy**: Set memory-centric batch operations approach
- [ ] Log: "development_environment_assessed"

### Step 4: Context Inheritance Validation (SYSTEM + PROJECT + PROGRESS)
- [ ] Confirm CAC system context active
- [ ] Confirm behavioral anchors loaded
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Confirm previous session context loaded and understood
- [ ] Verify accumulated domain expertise and established patterns
- [ ] Log: "context_inheritance_validated"

### Step 5: Development Ready State
- [ ] **ACTIVATION COMPLETE**: Use OPERATION ready state template from discovery map
- [ ] Announce readiness for progressive development work with session context
- [ ] Confirm next development objectives from current session context

**FAILURE TO COMPLETE SEQUENCE = INVALID ACTIVATION**

**Project**: Obsidian plugin to unhide .ai/README.md files in vault  
**Status**: Phase 1 - Foundation  
**Authority**: Cumulative Development - full autonomous development authority within project scope  
**CAC Integration**: Project operates within CAC behavioral framework with development focus

**üö® BEHAVIORAL ENFORCEMENT - DEVELOPMENT FOCUS**: 
- **CHAOTIC CONTEXT CONSUMPTION FORBIDDEN**: Follow this exact sequence, no random file browsing
- **CONTEXT INHERITANCE MANDATORY**: Build directly on previous session work without re-exploration
- **NO ASSUMPTIONS**: Read complete project context before making development decisions
- **PROGRESSIVE BUILDING**: Each session adds meaningful capability to existing foundation
- **ARCHITECTURAL CONSISTENCY**: Maintain established design patterns and technical decisions

## üéØ PROJECT-SPECIFIC BEHAVIORAL ANCHOR: PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT
**Reference**: Core/Projects/Templates/CumulativeDevelopment/README.md
**Critical Pattern**: When continuing development work:
1. **Load complete session context** ‚Üí Understand exactly where we left off ‚úÖ
2. **Build directly on previous work** ‚Üí No redundant exploration or starting over ‚úÖ 
3. **Apply accumulated domain expertise** ‚Üí Use all learnings from previous sessions ‚úÖ
4. **Maintain architectural consistency** ‚Üí Respect established patterns and decisions ‚úÖ
5. **Add meaningful capability** ‚Üí Each session progresses toward project objectives ‚úÖ

**Anti-Pattern Prevention**: 
- ‚ùå No redundant system exploration when context exists
- ‚ùå No architectural inconsistency with established patterns
- ‚ùå No ignoring previous session decisions and learnings
- ‚ùå No starting development work without understanding current state

**Context Inheritance Protocol**: 
- **Technical Context**: All previous architectural decisions inform current work
- **Progress Context**: Build incrementally on existing implementation
- **Domain Context**: Apply specialized knowledge accumulated over project lifetime
- **Quality Context**: Maintain code standards and patterns established in previous sessions

## üèóÔ∏è DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT INTEGRATION

### Claude Desktop + MCP Optimization
**Environment**: Desktop application with MCP filesystem access
**Capabilities**: File operations, JavaScript analysis, artifact creation
**Limitations**: No subprocess execution, no direct compilation/testing
**Strategy**: Code-by-design with architectural validation, user handles execution

### Development Workflow
- **Architecture First**: Design and validate before implementation
- **Memory-Centric**: Batch related operations, maintain context efficiently
- **Artifact-Focused**: Create complete, functional code artifacts
- **Validation-Oriented**: Structure for user testing and feedback integration

## üéØ CURRENT DEVELOPMENT PHASE: Phase 1 - Foundation

### Session Objectives
- Establish Obsidian plugin structure and manifest
- Create basic file visibility implementation framework
- Set up development and testing approach

### Previous Progress Summary
- Project initiated with CAC system integration
- Phase-based structure established
- Enhanced template system applied

### Next Development Steps
- Create plugin manifest (manifest.json)
- Implement basic plugin structure (main.ts)
- Design file visibility toggle mechanism

### Architectural Context
- Obsidian Plugin API integration
- TypeScript/JavaScript implementation
- File system interaction within Obsidian's sandbox
